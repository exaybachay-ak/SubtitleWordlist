240
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:40,390
HE BEGINS THE RUSSIAN CHAPTER
OF MY FAMILY HISTORY.

241
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,90
MIKHAIL WAS BORN
DURING THE REIGN OF
CATHERINE THE GREAT,

242
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,389
AT A TIME WHEN
THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE

243
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,100
WAS GROWING RICHER
THROUGH THE FUR TRADE.

244
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,30
MIKHAIL WAS ONE OF HUNDREDS
OF YOUNG RUSSIAN MEN

245
00:19:54,50 --> 00:19:56,600
CALLED PROMYSHLENNIKI.

246
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,239
THEY WERE TRAPPERS AND TRADERS

247
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,840
WHO WERE THE BACKBONE
OF THIS SOFT GOLD RUSH.

248
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,350
- THE FIRST RUSSIANS WHO CAME
TO ALASKA AND THE ALEUTIAN CHAIN

249
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,449
WERE MARINE MAMMAL HUNTERS,

250
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,320
AND MOSTLY WHAT ATTRACTED THEM
WAS THE SEA OTTER,

251
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,720
BECAUSE SEA OTTERS BROUGHT
EXCEEDINGLY HIGH PRICES.

252
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,260
SO THAT WAS WORTH THE RISKS.

253
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,399
- MIKHAIL TRAVELED OVER LAND
THOUSANDS OF MILES...

254
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,70
THEN HE SET SAIL
FOR BERING ISLAND,

255
00:20:32,90 --> 00:20:38,10
WHERE HE FIRST ENCOUNTERED
THE UNANGAN.

AND THAT KNOW-HOW

260
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,659

20,000 AND 25,000.

THE FACT IS THAT WITHIN 40 YEARS
OF THE RUSSIANS COMING,

ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS,

AND, YOU KNOW, RUSSIAN ORTHODOXY
IS EXTREMELY RITUALISTIC.

332

TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

335

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:21,350
COMING OVER HERE
TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE...

503
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,650
AND WHEN I COME HERE, I ALWAYS
STILL FEEL QUITE AT HOME,

504
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,20
EVEN IF IT'S BEEN A FEW DECADES
SINCE I'VE ACTUALLY SPENT

505
00:37:30,40 --> 00:37:42,870
MORE THAN A FEW DAYS HERE.

506
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,240
WHEN YOU COME HERE
TO SAINT GEORGE,

507
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,910
EVERYTHING IS NESTLED
ALL TOGETHER,

508
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:58,319
THE VILLAGE WITH THE BIRD CLIFFS
AND THE FUR SEALS.

509
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:15,430
IT'S ALL JUST RIGHT HERE
AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE VILLAGE.

510
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,910
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER,
REVEREND INNOKENTY LESTENKOF,

511
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,9
WAS THE FIRST LESTENKOF
ON THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS,

512
00:38:26,30 --> 00:38:30,950
AND HE SERVED THE PARISH HERE
IN THE LATE 1800s,

513
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:36,390
AND HERE IS WHERE HE IS BURIED--

514
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:51,370
REVEREND INNOKENTY
MIKHAILOVICH LESTENKOV.

515
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:57,680
IN THE BELIEF OF UNANGAN PEOPLE,
OUR LIFE IS A VISIT.

516
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,779
WE DON'T HAVE A WORD FOR DEATH.

517
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,980
WE USE A WORD THAT ACTUALLY
TRANSLATES INTO ENGLISH

518
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:18,830
AS "DONE VISITING THIS LAND."

519
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,630
WHEN THE AMERICANS TOOK OVER
THE FUR INDUSTRY

520
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,770
ON SAINT PAUL
AND SAINT GEORGE ISLANDS,

521
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,509
THEY BEGAN KEEPING
METICULOUS RECORDS.

522
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,280
PART OF MY JOB AT THE TRIBAL
GOVERNMENT OF SAINT PAUL

523
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,120
IS TO LOOK AT
THESE OLD ARCHIVES,

524
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,750
SO MY COWORKER
SAMANTHA ZACHAROF AND I

525
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,390
HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS
PORING OVER THESE RECORDS.

526
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,629
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS WENT BACK THAT FAR.

527
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,800
BOTH SAINT PAUL
AND SAINT GEORGE ISLANDS

528
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,130
WERE RUN LIKE COMPANY TOWNS.

529
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:03,910
THE UNANGAN WORKERS
WERE WARDS OF THE STATE.

530
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,80
- WE BECAME IN A STATE OF
SERVITUDE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

531
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,450
AS THE ONLY CAPTIVE LABOR FORCE
OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT

532
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,790
IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES.

533
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,730
- EVERY ASPECT
OF THE FUR INDUSTRY OPERATED

534
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,460
UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION,

535
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,700
AND WORKERS WERE GIVEN
ALLOTMENTS

536
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,509
THAT THEY USED
TO MAKE PURCHASES.

537
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,240
EVERY TRANSACTION WAS RECORDED
DOWN TO THE LAST PENNY.

538
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,980
SO FOR SOMEONE IN 1898
ON MARCH 26

539
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,820
TO PURCHASE TEA, SUGAR, MILK,
BUTTER, FLOUR, SOUP,

540
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,460
TOBACCO, MATCHES, FRUIT,

541
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,390
AND--I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS--
HANDKERCHIEFS,

542
00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:02,129
ONE PAIR OF BABY SHOES--
75 CENTS.

543
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,640
MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THE UNITED STATES

544
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,940
HAD A FUR SEAL INDUSTRY,

545
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,80
MUCH LESS THE CONDITIONS
WITH WHICH THE WORKFORCE,

546
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,580
THE UNANGAN PEOPLE,
HAD TO LIVE WITH.

547
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,89
- ALASKA WAS PURCHASED
FOR $7.2 MILLION.

548
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,390
THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS ALONE
HAVE PROBABLY PAID

549
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,660
FOR THE STATE OF ALASKA

550
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,859
AT LEAST 10 TIMES OVER.

551
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,730
I KNOW IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

552
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,900
DID WE GET OUR FAIR SHARE? NO.

553
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,710
IF YOU GET PAID 25 CENTS A SKIN
WHEN THAT SKIN

554
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:49,80
IS WORTH HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS,
I DON'T THINK SO.

555
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,950
- WHAT'S IN HERE?

556
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,990
- THIS IS JUST
THEIR ORDER FORMS FOR SEARS.

557
00:41:54,10 --> 00:41:55,590
- OK.

558
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,890
READING SOME OF THIS STUFF,
I HAVE TO STAND UP

559
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:05,129
AND JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ANGRY.

560
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,100
THAT'S THE HARD PART.

561
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,600
HOW DO YOU HAVE A PIECE
OF HISTORY BE KNOWN AND BE TOLD

562
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,940
WITHOUT MAKING
THE NEXT GENERATION ANGRY?

563
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,110
- THIS IS PART OF HISTORY,
NO MATTER HOW IT MAKES YOU FEEL.

564
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,140
- YEAH.

565
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,279
HOW DO YOU HAVE IT GO FORWARD
INTO THE FUTURE

566
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:30,560
AND BE USED SO AS
NOT TO REPEAT ITSELF?

567
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:39,460
I THINK IT AFFIRMS THE NEED
FOR THIS HISTORY TO BE KNOWN.

568
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:54,710
IT'S NOT JUST OUR HISTORY.
IT'S THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION.

569
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,780
BOTH MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER

570
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,20
WERE BORN
ON SAINT GEORGE ISLAND.

571
00:43:00,40 --> 00:43:05,590
MY FATHER, MICHAEL LESTENKOF,
WAS BORN IN 1913.

572
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:11,30
MY MOTHER STEFANIDA LEKANOF
WAS BORN IN 1919.

573
00:43:11,50 --> 00:43:17,670
IN 1938, THEY GOT MARRIED.

574
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,440
LIKE ALL THE MEN
ON SAINT GEORGE ISLAND,

575
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,110
MY FATHER WORKED
IN THE FUR SEAL INDUSTRY.

576
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,450
THAT'S HIM TAKING
A CIGARETTE BREAK

577
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,649
IN FRONT OF THE SEAL PLANT.

578
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,550
- THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
A LITTLE MORE. A LITTLE MORE.

579
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,350
THAT'S IT. COME ON.

580
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,490
- ALL IN A DAY'S WORK, THE FIRST
SEAL HARVEST WOULD BEGIN

581
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,730
WITH AN EARLY-MORNING ROUNDUP
FROM THE BEACH.

582
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,570
PLACING THEMSELVES BETWEEN
THE SEALS AND THE SEA,

583
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:54,740
SHOUTING AND WHISTLING,
THEY DRIVE THE SEALS INLAND.

584
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,510
USING LONG HICKORY STICKS,
THEY DIVIDE OUT A POD

585
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,310
OF ABOUT 6 TO 12 SEALS.

586
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,220
- YEAH. A LITTLE MORE.
THAT'S IT.

587
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,589
- EACH SEAL IS DELIVERED
A SINGLE BLOW TO THE HEAD,

588
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,90
WHICH STUNS THEM...

589
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:21,730
AND WITH A KNIFE PIERCING
TO THE HEART, THEY ARE KILLED.

590
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,100
THE WASHHOUSE BUILDING
ON SAINT GEORGE ISLAND

591
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,509
IS THE ONLY REMAINING EVIDENCE
OF WHAT WAS ONCE

592
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:32,210
A VERY BUSY FUR SEAL INDUSTRY.

593
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,850
- ONCE THE FUR SEAL PROCESS...

594
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,49
- ANTHONY MERCULIEF
IS ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE

595
00:44:37,70 --> 00:44:41,90
ON SAINT GEORGE ISLAND TO HAVE
WORKED AT THE SEAL PLANT.

596
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,360
- THE DUMP TRUCKS WOULD BRING
THE PELTS TO THIS PLATFORM HERE.

597
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,960
THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN,
AND THE SEAL SKINS

598
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,160
WERE THROWN INSIDE THE TANKS
THAT ARE IN THERE

599
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,870
THAT ARE FILLED WITH SALTWATER.

600
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,970
- SO THIS WOULD BE
THE SKIN HOUSE OR THE WASHHOUSE?

601
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,270
- WASHHOUSE. YEAH.

602
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,70
THIS IS WHERE THE SKINS
WERE BROUGHT IN

603
00:45:00,90 --> 00:45:02,240
THROUGH THE WINDOWS OVER THERE.

604
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,480
THIS WAS FILLED UP
WITH SALTWATER,

605
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,380
AND THE SKINS WERE PUT IN HERE
AND SOAKED OVERNIGHT.

606
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,380
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SKINS
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO FIT IN?

607
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:19,420
- IN EACH TANK,
PROBABLY 100 OR MORE.

608
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,60
THEY HAD AN OVERHEAD TROLLEY

609
00:45:21,80 --> 00:45:23,90
THAT HUNG FROM
THIS TRACK RIGHT HERE.

610
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,360
THEY WOULD FILL THE THING
WITH SEAL SKINS

611
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,670
AND HAUL THEM DOWN
THROUGH THIS TRACK

612
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,930
TO THAT FAR END OF THE BUILDING,

613
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,839
WHERE THEY WERE PUT
ON THE TABLES

614
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:38,180
AND GIVEN TO THE BLUBBER PEOPLE
TO BLUBBER THEM.

615
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,80
- THEN FROM IN HERE
AND ON THESE TRACKS,

616
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,750
IS THIS HOW SKINS WERE BROUGHT
INTO THIS ROOM?

617
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,550
- RIGHT.

618
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,490
- AND THIS WAS
THE BLUBBERY SHOP, HUH?

619
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,850
- YEAH.

620
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,259
- AND WHAT ARE THESE TABLES FOR?

621
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,160
- THIS IS WHERE SKINS
WERE STACKED.

622
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,500
- SO HOPEFULLY,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BIG PILE.

623
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,960
- RIGHT, AND SMALL SKINS.

624
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,400
- YEAH. OH, OK, SIZE.

625
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,940
- THE EASY ONES.

626
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,240
THE BIG ONES WERE STRINGY
AND HARD TO BLUBBER.

627
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,270
- OH, OK.
SO YOU BLUBBERED HERE, TOO.

628
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,440
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

629
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,540
- YOU WOULD REACH OVER
AND GRAB A SKIN,

630
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,210
PUT IT ON THE BEAM
FUR SIDE UP,

631
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,550
AND YOU'D GRAB A KNIFE
FROM HERE,

632
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,420
CUT THE EARS OFF,
CUT A LITTLE BIT

633
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,450
OF THE SKIN
AROUND THE ARM HOLES.

634
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,990
THEN YOU TAKE THE SKIN
AND TURN IT AROUND

635
00:46:25,10 --> 00:46:28,60
WITH THE BLUBBER SIDE UP
AND SCRAPE THE BLUBBER OFF.

636
00:46:28,80 --> 00:46:29,490
THEN WHEN YOU GOT DONE
WITH THAT,

637
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,30
YOU FLIP IT OVER
AND DO THE OTHER SIDE.

638
00:46:34,50 --> 00:46:38,200
- IN 2000, I CAME OVER WITH
MY DAD INTO THE SEAL PLANT HERE,

639
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,899
AND WHEN HE COUNTED DOWN,
HE SAID,

640
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,570
"THIS IS BLUBBER BEAM
NUMBER 13,"

641
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,580
AND HE SAID, "NO ONE WANTED
TO BLUBBER HERE

642
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,509
"BECAUSE 13
WAS AN UNLUCKY NUMBER,

643
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,180
"BUT SINCE I WAS BORN
ON OCTOBER 13, 1913,

644
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,460
IT'S MY LUCKY NUMBER, SO THIS
IS WHERE I BLUBBERED PELTS."

645
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,360
HE'D SAY, "I WAS BORN
ON THE 13th HOUR, TOO,"

646
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,790
BUT I DON'T THINK HE WAS.

647
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,100
HE JUST THREW THAT IN
FOR THE STORY.

648
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:21,250
[BOTH LAUGH]

649
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,480
IN 1941, THERE WERE
ABOUT 500 UNANGAN

650
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,650
LIVING ON SAINT GEORGE
AND SAINT PAUL ISLANDS,

651
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:34,430
BUT ONE YEAR LATER,
THERE WOULD BE NONE.

652
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,259
WORLD WAR II SHATTERED LIFE
ON THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS.

653
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,270
- WE USED TO HEAR THE PLANES
GOING OVER THE ISLAND.

654
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:48,910
THE BLACKOUTS STARTED RIGHT
AFTER PEARL HARBOR WAS BOMBED.

655
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,980
- MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
MARY BOURDUKOFSKY

656
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,940
WAS A YOUNG WOMAN
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN

657
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,910
WHEN WORLD WAR II BROKE OUT.

658
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,250
SAME RIGHT HERE.
- MM-HMM.

659
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,350
ALL THE WINDOWS AT NIGHT,
YOU HAMMER A BLANKET

660
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,560
TO MAKE IT DARK, NO LIGHTS,

661
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,220
NO KIND OF A LIGHT,
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED

662
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,529
TO EVEN SMOKE CIGARETTE
OUTSIDE OR NOTHING.

663
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:21,540
- IN JUNE 1942, THE JAPANESE
BOMBED THE HARBOR AT UNALASKA.

664
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,840
THEY INVADED THE ISLANDS
OF ATTU AND KISKA...

665
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,350
AND THEY TOOK
AMERICAN CITIZENS CAPTIVE.

666

00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,270
THE WAR BECAME
TOO HORRIBLY REAL.

671

IT SEEMED SENSIBLE TO PREPARE,

672
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,470
SO THE FIRST AND ONLY
AIR RAID SHELTER

673
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,669
IS BEING ERECTED ON SAINT PAUL.

674
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,510
WE APPEALED TO
THE GOVERNMENT AGENT

675
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:01,650
TO TAKE SOME ACTION
FOR THE COMMUNITY'S SAFETY.

676
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:10,190
WE BEGGED HIM TO EVACUATE
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AT LEAST.

677
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,860
- THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
ORDERED A COMPLETE EVACUATION

678
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,60
OF ALL UNANGAN FROM THE ALEUTIAN
AND PRIBILOF ISLANDS.

680
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,169
- NO. WE DIDN'T KNOW.

681
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,800
- THAT YOU WERE BEING EVACUATED?

682
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,540
- NO. WE DIDN'T KNOW.
- WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?

683
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,80
- IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON,

684
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:38,880
AND THEY USED TO HAVE A BIG
BALL GAME GOING ON ON SUNDAYS.

685
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,620
THAT SUNDAY HAPPENED TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY,

686
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,629
AND MY HUSBAND WAS A BALLPLAYER,
AND HE WENT OUT, BUT I WAS HOME.

687
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,90
I HAD A LITTLE,
3-MONTHS-OLD BABY

688
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:56,600
AND A TWO-YEAR-OLD LITTLE BOY.

689
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,810
SO I WAS WASHING DIAPERS
BY WASHBOARD, YOU KNOW?

690
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,509
I DIDN'T HAVE NO
WASHING MACHINE,

691
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:10,250
AND THE BIG TRANSPORT LANDED
OVER THERE IN EAST LANDING.

692
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,280
PEOPLE WERE JUST PUZZLED,
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

693
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,350
AND THEN MY HUSBAND CAME
RUNNING HOME TO TELL ME

694
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,220
THAT THEY'RE TAKING EVERYBODY.

695
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,160
SAID, "THEY TELL US TO TAKE JUST
WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR BACK

696
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,460
AND CHANGE OF CLOTHES.
THAT'S ALL,"

697
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,670
AND WE DIDN'T HAD NO SUITCASES
BECAUSE WE NEVER TRAVEL,

698
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,540
SO I START FILLING UP CLEAN
50-POUND FLOUR SACKS

699

700
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:47,690
AND A CARDBOARD BOX I HAVE,
I FILLED THAT ONE, TOO.

THEY WALKED ALL THE WAY
TO EAST LANDING HERE.

702
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:00,430
IT WAS SO SAD.
WOMEN WERE CRYING.

703
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,629
ELDERS WERE CRYING,

704
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:10,880
AND PEOPLE CARRY A SACK
OF THEIR CLOTHES.

705
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,80
- EVERYONE WAS EVACUATED--

708
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:29,190

IN SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA,

709
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:35,370

I HAD TO DRESS MY LITTLE KIDS
WITH WHATEVER THEY HAD.

713
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:57,220
ALL THEIR THINGS GOT WORN OUT.
THEY GOT SMALL.

714
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,330
MY LITTLE BOY HAD NO SHOES,
AND IT'S BARE FLOOR,

715
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,960
AND THE MEMORIES
COME BACK TO ME.

716
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,400
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH.

717
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,670
WHAT THEY ISSUE US IS POWDERED--

718
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:17,370

719
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:23,80
WE HAD NO STOVE TO COOK, ANYWAY.

NO BATHS, NO TOILETS,

YOU HAVE TO WALK ON A PLANK.

723
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,60
- THERE WAS JUST THE HOLE.

724
00:52:35,80 --> 00:52:40,200
- YEAH. THE WASTE JUST GOES
IN THE BAY...

725
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,770

AROUND, AND WE COULDN'T EAT IT.

HOW COULD WE?

727
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:53,9

COLD, SORES, IMPETIGOS...

728
