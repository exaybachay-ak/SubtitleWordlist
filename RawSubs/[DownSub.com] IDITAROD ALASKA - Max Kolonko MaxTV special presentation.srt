00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,719
Mariusz Max Kolonko presents:

2
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,000
Discovering America.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,719
When it begins

4
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,299
it's more popular here than the Super Bowl.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,799
Just like in the football league,
fans have their favorites,

6
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,479
and gallery of stars.

7
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,320
That's Iditarod

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,119
the world's greatest sled dog race,

9
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,179
finished only by over 600 adventurers
for 35 years.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,359
"Iditarod"

11
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,359
in Athabasca Indian language means:
"a place far away".

12
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,158
Today,
on Discovering America.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,799
"A Place Far Away"
producer: Yvette Williams.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,79
Local terms are descriptive,

15
00:01:36,79 --> 00:01:38,119
and come from the Indian language.

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,200
"Alaska" means a land which is no island.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,79
In fact, it's the largest America's state.

18
00:01:45,79 --> 00:01:49,719
20% of U.S. territory,
looking mostly like this:

19
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,79
In summer temperature rises
up to 30 degrees,

20
00:01:53,79 --> 00:01:56,39
In winter, drops to -50.

21
00:01:56,40 --> 00:02:02,780
In March, wind blows on the streets,
among piles of snow reaching the rooftops.

22
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,959
The biggest town - Anchorage is less populated
than Poland's Bialystok,

23
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,120
but still it makes half of Alaska's population,
which is a bit more than 0,5 million people.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,800
The tallest buildings
have about dozen of floors,

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,319
which is accordant to the law
and common sense.

26
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,599
the ground quakes here often.

27
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,39
These mountains keep growing
with the highest America's peak Mt. McKinley.

28
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,280
In the mountains' shadow rest
what's left after 7 on Richter scale.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,39
People won't come back here.

30
00:02:34,39 --> 00:02:39,39
Nearby you can hear death,
and the sound it makes:

31
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,799
It's snow rubbing snow.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Falling into this water
means death.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,840
That's the "Water Of Return".

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,400
The name was given by the Capt. Cook's crew,
who thought it was a river.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,199
The ship turned around,
as they didn't find a river,

36
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,879
thus the name "Water Of Return".

37
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,719
The water is not moved by the river's current,
but the ocean's tide,

38
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,79
sometimes with 20 km/h speed,
raising the water level by 10 meters.

39
00:03:07,80 --> 00:03:09,800
But under the snow, there's a life:

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,60
when the winter ends,

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,219
belugas will come-the white whales.

42
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,79
I'm on my way to Wasilla,
where the Huskies are waiting for me.

43
00:03:26,80 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going down one of America's most scenic drives.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,240
Alaska has only 8 highways
well maintained all summer,

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,520
so you can use them in winter.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,80
Road signs
serve as shooting targets.

47
00:03:40,80 --> 00:03:41,479
Nobody like Feds here.

48
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,759
65% of Alaska is owned by the state.

49
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:51,619
These signs better be respected:
avalanches killed many tourists taking pictures.

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,199
<i>My top dog is the white giant over here.</i>

51
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,439
Karen is preparing dogs for the team.

52
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,959
There will be 10 dogs' sled
half of the standard number,

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,279
but still it's a powerful force.

54
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,879
How powerful, I'm about to find out.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,759
- 18F below at my house this morning,

56
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,360
-What boots you got?
-These are military boots,

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,360
good for very low temperatures

58
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,600
New York shoe looks poor in comparison.

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Diane is one of the veterans of Iditarod.

60
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,959
- I started in '84, it took 12 days.
and 15 hours to complete the race

61
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,759
- All this time I slept only 23 hours.
Not to fall asleep is the most difficult.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,79
-You feel so tired, everything hurts
you just want to sleep.

63
00:05:03,79 --> 00:05:09,99
The race goes nearly trough entire Alaska
over 1800 km on sideways.

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,399
It will take over week or 2,
to cover this distance,

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
depending on conditions.

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,680
Iditarod has historic roots:

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,759
22 January 1925,
a telegram came from Alaska to Washington:

68
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,759
In a small town Nome,
a diphtheria epidemic outbroke.

69
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,360
The one thing that could save the people
was the huskies and mushers,

70
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,879
who moved to Nome
the same way that the race goes today.

71
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,839
That's the dog which reached Nome as first,
carrying the vaccines.

72
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,600
Its monument stands today
in Central Park in New York.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,399
Every race's participant has such an envelope
in memory of those events.

74
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,519
And also now, as then,
the race helps those in need.

75
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,720
This is Tim.

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,399
He's 14, and has only few months of life left.

77
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,720
Tim suffers from incurable
nervous system disease.

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,660
Make a Wish Foundation
paid for his participation

79
00:06:15,40 --> 00:06:18,960
in occasional start in Iditarod.

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
Tim loves dogs. He had one
but it couldn't pull him anymore.

81
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,480
Tim's parents came here from Colorado.

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,600
They believe, that nature will help Tim
to at least forget about disease.

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,360
Now Diane with friends
is preparing a sled for Tim.

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,759
-What kind of breed is that?
-Any breed, that can run and pull

85
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,319
- That brown one has a lot of Greyhound the one here looks more like Husky,

86
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,839
- it depends on how tough they are

87
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,719
- Can they survive in low temperatures?

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
- Can you too?

89
00:07:00,79 --> 00:07:03,959
Dogs know they'll run soon
and it's an event of a day.

90
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,920
Big fuss starts,
New York musher has no experience with dogs.

91
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,000
Huskies are very patience
and help in putting harnesses on.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Each dog is a cog in a well oiled machine.

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,399
Scooby will be in a pair with Swing.

94
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,39
Scooby may be ready, but the camera is done.

95
00:07:24,40 --> 00:07:27,360
Saliva froze on the objective instantly.

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,879
10 dogs' team passes by like a locomotive.

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Only in slow motion you can see the details.

98
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,319
Huskies are in fact 2 breeds
of Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute.

99
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,139
They can sense a danger like a weak lake's ice,

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,639
and lead the sled themselves.

101
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,79
Huskies are born to run,

102
00:07:52,79 --> 00:07:55,680
when they slip their chain,
they won't go back when called.

103
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,639
A single Malamute can pull a car,
sled, even a truck.

104
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,600
After a while, they run steady, trotting.

105
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,839
They could run like this 30-50 km daily,

106
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,240
with the average speed of over 30 km/h.

107
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,540
Dogs are not the same
-the best are worth $15,000 each.

108
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,519
Vern Holter is a race's veteran.

109
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,39
He participated 23 times in it.

110
00:08:35,39 --> 00:08:39,80
-We're gonna take 10 dogs
and have a 15 km warm-up.

111
00:08:39,80 --> 00:08:43,120
- 90% of the route you'll spend here
as a musher.

112
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,679
- This is a break to slow down the team,

113
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,879
- dogs will press ahead,
no matter the weight on the sled.

114
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:55,539
- Sleds are traditionally hand-made
by the Athabasca Indians.

115
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,39
- You'll give commands to the dogs:- go left-ho, go right-geee

116
00:09:00,39 --> 00:09:04,259
- On the crossroads you say: straight.

117
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,740
- They run without a command,but to stop them you say: woe

118
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,480
- At the same time you press the break,
and take an anchor.

119
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,720
- Only the anchor stuck into the snow 
can stop the team for good.

120
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,19
-Do dogs listen to those commands?
-You hope they do.

121
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,799
First I need to visit changing room.

122
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,600
What works in NY, seems a toy here.

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,159
These are Mukluks,
Eskimos and Athabascans wear these.

124
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,480
They are light and have leather soles.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,200
Vern promotes also American Army's boots:
<i>these are the best for Alaska.</i>

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>What's the difference between this</i>
<i>and what's in your hands?</i>

127
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,799
<i>This suit protects your legs</i>
<i>today it's -20.</i>

128
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,559
You need several layers,
no fashion rules apply,

129
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,339
clothes must be to large:
free spaces will give me warming air.

130
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,860
2 layers on my head,
and an "astronaut suit".

131
00:10:12,39 --> 00:10:17,399
It's an Eskimo's jacket:
no zip, it's not easy to put it on,

132
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,240
better to have someone to help.

133
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,80
That's not all,

134
00:10:23,80 --> 00:10:28,560
I need 3 pairs of gloves
second one for warming my wrists.

135
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,440
And finally: 10X size.

136
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,879
- What you're wearing now is what I wear during Iditarod.- my personal parka

137
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,600
A flashlight is a must,
dogs love to run at night.

138
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,279
- Notebook allows for dog's health control

139
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
- Inspector wrote here:
Team looks good",

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,919
and drew a smile,
which means that team is really looking good

141
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,799
But that's not always the case.

142
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,679
At least few dogs dies on each race.

143
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,279
Half of teams won't reach the finish line.

144
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,120
It's all about the training.

145
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,679
- Keep your knees bent 
and I'll be balancing the sled.

146
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,199
- Let's take the dogs.

147
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,480
Each team has specific composition,
like a hockey team.

148
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,919
Huskies are reliable,
but difficult and often competitive.

149
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,459
They can't wait to run,
one gives me a dog-friendship sing.

150
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,799
- Runners are replaceable and mostly plastic

151
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,439
- Different type of plastic is used for different kind of snow,

152
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,840
- Eskimos know about dozen of snow kinds.

153
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,80
- Race's rule no.1 is no help from the outside.

154
00:11:44,80 --> 00:11:47,840
Each checkpoint controls the dogs.

155
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,840
- What does it mean when they are barking?
-They're just telling you, they're happy and want to run.

156
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,300
When I pick up the anchor,
the fuss ends.

157
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,759
I go trough Alaska now,
and I must say it's not easy.

158
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,460
These dogs are the hardiest breed
of huskies,

159
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:20,759
they can run pulling the sled all day,
70 - 100 km daily, 25 km/h.

160
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,720
For me, as a musher, it's not easy job,

161
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,320
as there are branches, twigs, trees,

162
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,240
I must stand with my knees bent,
and control the dogs.

163
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,279
Doing this for 5,8,10 hours a day,

164
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,139
it's no picnic, believe me.

165
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
There's no time for more training.

166
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,519
Only one day left to the race.

167
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,919
Competitors will start from these streets tomorrow.

168
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,759
The snow is brought from the nearby mountains.

169
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,759
There's a lot of it this year.

170
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,600
<i>It will take them about 3 hours</i>
<i>to cover the streets.</i>

171
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,360
That's the last restful night
for 84 mushers and their teams,

172
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,960
who run in this year's marathon.

173
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,279
The race's participants are in town:
all hotels are full.

174
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,19
Anchorage has its Super Bowl.

175
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,919
You may recognize competitors
by the dog trailers.

176
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,919
<i>There are 10 dogs at each side</i>

177
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:06,519
Dogs, as the racehorses,
get special treatment.

178
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,679
- We've been training since mid October t's our first race, we want to finish it.

179
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,919
Mushers are heroes of a day.

180
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,199
Start will be broadcasted live on TV.

181
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,320
Reporters are plugged in,
local papers print the starting lists.

182
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,80
-Who's winning?
-They're all are now, but we know the winner:

183
00:14:26,80 --> 00:14:27,600
-Why?

184
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
- She's from our town 
- it's her 7th race, 5th in the row,

185
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,840
she's got a great team,
she's no 35 in the paper.

186
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,580
Others, have their own types:

187
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,519
-What brings you here?
-The race!

188
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,439
-I like the way you say: "race"

189
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,80
We have 83 competitors on the list.

190
00:14:52,80 --> 00:14:53,320
From which countries?

191
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,000
- Mostly Alaska, also Canada, Colorado,<Norway, Serbia.

192
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,659
- No Poland?

193
00:15:01,80 --> 00:15:05,919
But there's a Polish element here:
on the sausage stand. $5 for one.

194
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,720
Alaska is a strange land:

195
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,240
white bears walk on the streets,
PETA would be very busy here,

196
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,759
is it wasn't afraid of the locals.

197
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,399
Various kinds and colors of furs,
remind of the Gold Rush in Klondike,

198
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,480
with a grizzly bear
blessing  a street fair with both paws.

199
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,679
Finally, competitors come out.

200
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,000
This street race is of ceremonial kind.

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
Popular Senator Lisa Murkowski
is cutting the ribbon.

202
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,80
Each of the mushers

203
00:15:37,80 --> 00:15:41,759
paid several to about
dozen of thousands of dollars to be here.

204
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,659
I recognize Tim,
who celebrates thanks to Make a Wish Foundation.

205
00:15:49,80 --> 00:15:54,799
He will cross the start line
with the race's veteran Jeff King

206
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,199
This is Dee Dee Jonrowe,
who many people believe in.

207
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
- I hope to win this year.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,600
- What are the 3 most important things for you? 
- Money.Would be good to win some.

209
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,720
Dee Dee is pro.
She has earned over $400,000 on the races so far.

210
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,960
Everybody's ready except for...

211
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,720
I don't ask,

212
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,39
but I know that Diane and Karen
don't have $30,000 from sponsors,

213
00:16:23,39 --> 00:16:25,39
to join this madness.

214
00:16:25,39 --> 00:16:28,120
The prices of participation
are up to $100,000:

215
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,440
in dog's food, transportation costs, assistants' help.

216
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,759
To join this race,
you need to finish different one,

217
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,639
at least 500 miles long.

218
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,100
That's why here are the best of the best,

219
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,300
and those, who sponsors believe in.

220
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,960
The prize is nearly $100,000
and as much again in advertising contracts.

221
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,620
First musher on the midway
will receive $4,000 in gold lumps.

222
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,98
And so the world's greatest sled dog race begins.

223
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:10,000
Only half of teams will make it to the end.

224
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,180
They will spend 2 weeks
in snow and even -50 degrees.

225
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,520
Sometimes, they'll sleep with dogs
to stay warm.

226
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,420
26 checkpoints will control the dogs' health.

227
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,860
Teams of even 20 dogs,
go in 2 minutes intervals.

228
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,200
Only the toughest half of them
will finish the race.

229
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,799
Running at night will help to save the time.

230
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,599
Dogs love low temperatures,
nap time is in the morning.

231
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,119
But when the wind blows from the front
dogs won't go.

232
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,199
Their survival instinct is stronger
than musher's persuasions.

233
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,559
Helicopters will take those,
who can't keep up the pace.

234
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,839
Nome, a small town lost at the end of the world

235
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,879
is 12 days from here,

236
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,40
in the fairy tale land far far away.

237
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,199
Jeff King was 5th.

238
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,400
He run 1853 km in 9 days, 15 hours and 5 minutes,

239
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
although wolfs ate the signs
before the finish line.

240
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Dee Dee Jonrowe broke her arm
during the race, and backed out.

241
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,440
She beat the breasts cancer,
which she considers her biggest success.

242
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
Tim came back to Colorado.
His condition didn't improve.

243
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,480
He counted 8 kinds of snow
and 7 colors of life on Alaska.

244
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,880
He says, next year he'll start in Iditarod.

245
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,960
I believe he will.

246
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,200
Editor: Tim Newman

247
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,279
Segment Producer: Yvette Williams

248
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,119
Director: Mariusz Max Kolonko

249
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,39
Based on the book: "Discovering America"

250
00:18:56,79 --> 00:18:57,159
Producer:

251
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,279
Today on "Discovering America" - Alaska.

252
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,319
Not just from the car's window,
but also from the dogs' sled,

253
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,639
that I will drive on "Discovering America".

254
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,79
Stay tuned tonight, if we get there,
everything's possible.

255
00:19:13,79 --> 00:19:18,139
This hood is p....s me off,
I'm f....g tired of it!

256
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,320
Can anyone turn the heat on it this ....

257
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Is this ice tea drinkable already or what?
