1
00:00:01,10 --> 00:00:05,500
all three species of North American
bears a found here

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,840
grounders black bears and polar bears

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,300
my name is Chris Morgan

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,880
have dedicated half my life to the study
in conservation of bass

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,330
now was embarked upon a three
thousand-mile journey

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,418
into the heart the Bears world

7
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,299
with me my good friend and filmmaker Joe
Pontecorvo

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,769
you don't notice it call for you look at
your crowd he crossed over everything

9
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,860
together

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,140
our goal is to peel back the layers a
myth

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,960
and misunderstanding on this complex
creature CI clown

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,360
put it in a place that to better
understand their personalities

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,670
all of them out the window

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,940
to witness first-hand how they live
today

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,298
and what the future might hold for the
Bears

16
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,350
the last frontier in

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,369
the

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,510
my journey has taken me through the
season as the brown bear

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,100
and black bear

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,710
from an area nearly untouched by man

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,169
to the most the urban environment in
alaska now

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,800
but the very edge of the North American
continent a new adventure is about to

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,000
unfold

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,710
I leave behind the cold metal and steel

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,240
prudhoe bay

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,240
and head to the home the polar bear

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,530
a plane touches down on a four mile long
windswept strip of land

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,378
known as barter island on the edge the
Beaufort Sea

29
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,620
fewer than 300 residents

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,220
mostly in Nubia eskimo call this remote
ireland home

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,239
but they are not alone

32
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,510
to share this frigid coast line with
another

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,569
great hunter the polar bear

34
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,810
0

35
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,640
while the rest to the Bears have to end
up for winter

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,640
polar bears sensed a change in season
and are anxious for the chill to set in

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,250
I'll

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,650
harbors a ice loving creatures 0

39
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,380
from an early age they are drawn to it 0

40
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,380
investigating any new formations on the
wart

41
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,940
what's fascinating to me about these
polar bears is that this own finely

42
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,730
tuned in adapted to life on

43
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,940
ice little better come right down the
street

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,410
here and broken through you look at 4.3
broken through this I see in fact the I

45
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,700
just got the form already

46
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,709
so there for ever testing the ice
conditions to see whose firm enough for

47
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,800
them to head out onto

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,800
and is not yet obviously

49
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,358
as adults they depend upon ice to hunt
unlike brown bears

50
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,890
polar bears a highly specialized
carnivals and hunt

51
00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,890
almost exclusively one animal seals

52
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,409
the ring seal looks nervously around
exposed on this open expanse

53
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,290
the without firm in a vise

54
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,289
this bear has little chance to hunt down
the seal

55
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,860
it's late October and my now the ocean
should be frozen over

56
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,360
but this year winter has come late part
to the Laguna covered with ice

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,210
but the ocean

58
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,489
has yet to be tamed for now the Bears

59
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,490
trapped on land unable to hunt Mon

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,470
locals call this area the Polar Bear
campground

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,290
it's a nursery of sorts a safe haven for
mothers and young

62
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,660
this time of year

63
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,610
when other polar bears are waiting to
see ice 24 pregnant females are waiting

64
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,979
for enough snow to take their maternity
dans

65
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,389
this whole area in fact is really
important denning

66
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,860
females when they're pregnant they come
give birth in the habitat along this

67
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,570
coast here

68
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:30,570
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
so many other females return to the same

69
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,500
area

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:42,500
to raise their cubs

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,430
they seem to have this recognition when
it comes to playing

72
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,780
female playing in one car was playing
with another come from its

73
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,780
its quite the interesting scenario
that's going on

74
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,910
at making a beeline right for thanks I
we've only been here a few minutes

75
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:13,690
an already we've attracted some
attention

76
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm directly off when from he got a nose
in the average income twice and

77
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,229
she's coming this way we prolly won't
have a very long before we have to

78
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,440
make a hasty retreat you know the most
predatory in the bathroom

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,740
there is capable of great speeches
grizzly bears are you know they can run

80
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,950
35 miles an hour

81
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,310
so

82
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,520
there

83
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,510
think it's time to get in the pope she's
moving away with some determination we

84
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,659
need to make a retreat if you wanna jump
on Joe

85
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,660
guy looks like he's getting a really I
did take the chicken salad she can't

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,150
access

87
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,289
can't figure out for a meal of as how
they live their lives

88
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,500
they are curious creditors

89
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,760
everything about is about surviving the
cold

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,760
and hunting seals being a specialist is
two key to surviving the Arctic

91
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,469
it is true for the Bears as it is for
the Nubia eskimos

92
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,530
centuries these two hundred if the
article made their living

93
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,530
from the ocean the lives connected by
the animals they hunted

94
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,699
twice a year in spring and fall the new
PR eskimos hunt

95
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,720
bowhead whales

96
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,410
discarded remains a left on this bone
pile

97
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,410
in

98
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,360
seven o'clock in the morning with were
only

99
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,460
outskirts of town and is a good spot to
wait for bass right here

100
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,599
because ever seem to like coming out
under the cover of darkness

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,210
sometimes a case and wait in line around
a long time for

102
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,210
so what we're doing right now see if any
show up in his crossed

103
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,250
this guy's some close as we wanna get to
wale Meek

104
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,170
with this high fat content may help some
bears get through these tough times

105
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,930
when there's little else to eat if
warming trends continue

106
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,989
competition for this small pile of food
could get fierce

107
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,810
well for species already on the brink

108
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,810
polar bears will have some tough times
ahead

109
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,870
overnight snow flurry leaves fresh trips
for this young arctic fox to play in

110
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,220
up the icy lagoon is

111
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,240
to love activity the Bears use this new
platform to practice their light as a

112
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
feather walk

113
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,590
sea ice unlike fresh water rice

114
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:58,590
is flexible which gives the bears a lot
to experiment with

115
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,000
the fibers Bailey Wales used to filter
their food

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
has become the perfect choice for these
young cubs

117
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,930
play attracts attention and quickly
their mom claims the large Bailey

118
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:28,930
to strip out what he can from it I'm

119
00:10:35,80 --> 00:10:39,940
with the bone pile nearly exhausted his
mother frantically dicks was scrapped

120
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,60
buried in the snow

121
00:10:43,60 --> 00:10:46,69
but her fine soon draws attention from
another family

122
00:10:46,69 --> 00:10:53,69
ok

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,69
tensions are high

124
00:11:02,69 --> 00:11:05,89
as bears on cover every last bit of
whalebone

125
00:11:05,89 --> 00:11:12,89
scraping want me to count from the bones

126
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,680
a find like this is worth protecting

127
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,729
and his mother bear is not about to give
up a meal so easily

128
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:40,730
them

129
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,480
more

130
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,000
this young man I will have to seek out
his own meal

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
fortunately for him the weather appears
to be getting worse

132
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,970
temperatures have dipped to a
bone-chilling twenty degrees below

133
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,490
Greece ice

134
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,330
starting to cover the water

135
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:51,330
and winds batter the tiny island

136
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,720
the town is battening down the hatches
as the storm sets in

137
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,940
I'm on

138
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,940
ones ice begins to form the ocean
freezes over in just a few days

139
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:46,129
winter has finally taken hold I'm

140
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,379
the town now in its final days of
sunlight

141
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,800
bids farewell to the Bears as they head
out

142
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,800
onto the pack ice to hunt I

143
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,410
the Sun will vanish below the horizon

144
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,329
I'm and not reappear for another two
months

145
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,380
I'm

146
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:21,380
for now the world is in darkness

147
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,420
miles out on the pack ice polar bears a
hunting seals

148
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,450
stalking their prey I'm in the inky
blackness have winter

149
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:42,450
on

150
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,360
near the end of January the Sun begins
to reappear

151
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,59
on

152
00:15:02,59 --> 00:15:05,660
it's a time of transition

153
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,730
with more light each day

154
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:16,730
and by many in mid-spring the Sun is up
24 hours a day

155
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:24,529
and it's safe enough for us to venture
out onto the pack ice

156
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,439
when the eight miles out on a thin shell
for voice

157
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,129
searching for polar bears

158
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,689
but I'd be foolish to attempt this alone
of

159
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:40,290
it

160
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,410
Dale brower grew up on the North Slope
maybe we'll

161
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,430
get on a high point look around meaning

162
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,839
he grew up in the world completely alien
to most diverse

163
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,139
0 he's a really fresh

164
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,800
is that actually on top us LEC tracks
from a five hours ago

165
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,99
maybe 14 hours ago solely they weren't
here then

166
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,199
that's for sure he might have heard the
snow we see the in in

167
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,449
kinda snuck back often new this these
pressure ridges hear him he could just

168
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,609
be hiding out with

169
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,870
up

170
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,160
in this feature was white landscape it's
the best to have the advantage

171
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,370
problem is if they're off in the
distance of the behind the ice to easily

172
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,850
obscured even a large animal like a
polar bear

173
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,189
is this a weather from

174
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:31,540
coming in here yes actually the water
skied us

175
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,559
their water from the openly reflecting
in the sky a

176
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,620
so if you headed to to all those clouds
you find open water open water area

177
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,620
under me and has a good chance as for
the polar bears that were tracking here

178
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,940
it's been an exhaustive search and still
the bear remains elusive

179
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,460
when we check in which way the wind is
blowing

180
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,960
just so that entryway is on the opposite
end

181
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
we own it facing the wind

182
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,310
room because that's really important
when it blows for your fifty miles an

183
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,330
hour up

184
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,169
the morning snow cluttering our camp is
modest

185
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,720
the functional in every way up

186
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,250
I'm discovering there's little that dale
does that doesn't relate directly to our

187
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,429
own survival

188
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,820
up even the caribou hides seem to be the
perfect

189
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,830
insulation against the cold CR

190
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,830
fits in the by giving cell phone up

191
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:38,450
why

192
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,190
polisher that's my polar bear

193
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,740
it's the best for out there is a fist
for keeping the window

194
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,470
oh yeah its keeps the window and then it
does Andrew

195
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,840
it doesn't frost so does that collects
snow and stuff

196
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,100
interested in in it stays pretty clean

197
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,969
even know you you get it dirty you can
just ripen in the snow in the here with

198
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,140
this clean itself

199
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,970
basically like a polar bear after its
done with skill

200
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,160
this Robin the snow take us know about
the

201
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,160
just take longer stirred up for

202
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,190
polar bears a stealth hunters and just
because you don't see them

203
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,750
doesn't mean they're not there see what
we can do

204
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:36,750
outbreak calls perfect vantage point as
or send the perfect vantage point

205
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,260
looking for polar bears

206
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,270
all camps right here it is easy to
forget this

207
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,360
Mac bank right in the middle polar bear
habitat

208
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,10
all the way to the horizon all I can see
is

209
00:19:58,10 --> 00:20:02,940
ice giant jagged peaks and troughs
devices far as you can see

210
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,300
and is a barren hardstyle landscape

211
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,940
she can read the ice here well you not
going to survive

212
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,960
polar bears a master's

213
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,450
reading the ice good patrolling the edge
elite

214
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,29
smiling for any trace of a seal

215
00:20:22,29 --> 00:20:26,820
well

216
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,780
well but sneaking up on the ceiling

217
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,790
open water is a challenge even for a
polar bear

218
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:41,790
well

219
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,100
the best chance for me list sniff out
the seals breathing hole

220
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,69
or even a den with seal pups it

221
00:21:01,69 --> 00:21:05,428
it's a rare sight but dale has observed
polar bears hunting

222
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,49
like the there was a whole here Cheryl

223
00:21:10,49 --> 00:21:15,839
see if the whole is here

224
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,129
he could now ok well the whole check
this site out where the field

225
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:28,39
hill this basile out it's one of the
earliest instinctive behaviors for polar

226
00:21:28,39 --> 00:21:28,759
bear cubs

227
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,199
up while their mom rests

228
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,359
up these cultural practice what it takes

229
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,759
to become the apex predator the Arctic

230
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:44,789
up learning to lead with your nose up

231
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:51,429
investigate anything out of the ordinary
leap across

232
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:57,150
unstable chunks a vice and of course

233
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,200
the belly flop but when Mom homes

234
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,280
the Cubs know it's time to continue with
the real heart

235
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,280
0

236
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,260
polar bear tracks have led us here a
whaling cam

237
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,679
pushed to the edge in the lead a bear
was spotted just a day ago

238
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,240
perhaps the very one we're looking for

239
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,910
to the new Pia whale hunting isn't
ancient way of life

240
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:40,910
continues nearly unchanged today good

241
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,550
with 24 hours have lighted the rhythm of
life is set by the whales

242
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,280
not the Sun

243
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,30
the

244
00:22:54,30 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm

245
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:03,260
further

246
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,429
whale hunting is by far the most
dangerous part of their subsistence life

247
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,30
these young people doing it just the way
that their ancestors did

248
00:23:13,30 --> 00:23:16,760
he's constantly to any 22 years old

249
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,690
the beach gonna roll and its importance
to the community is vital

250
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:29,410
your when you become a captain in its
your first will you give the poor thing

251
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,280
way to all the whaling crews

252
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,970
you just learned over time that what you
kids

253
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,490
is really yours as a hunter you're here
too he peed

254
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,450
the town in the family's not really for
your so

255
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,460
the new PS commitment to this tradition
has helped keep his party the coastline

256
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,110
3 I've

257
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,659
oil development in without their
protection

258
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,990
this vital habitat may disappear
completely

259
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,910
while

260
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:06,910
in the background blowhole maybe I'll
wait is over

261
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,960
as the whale approaches

262
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,960
to camp becomes dead silent what

263
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:26,490
way as soon as the whale surfaces

264
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:36,260
two bogeys launched is a tense moment as
the men Patil towards the massive whale

265
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:44,150
somewhere just under the surface

266
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,70
happening while by hand is extremely
dangerous

267
00:24:47,70 --> 00:24:50,200
bowhead whales can weigh sixty tons

268
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,200
one swipe up its enormous tail fluke
could easily crushed a tiny craft

269
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,630
up

270
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,669
because colonels with the clinic at the
whaler to the water

271
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:17,669
two holes through the ice to go right
through

272
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:24,669
block and tackle a little bit whole
whaling

273
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,320
you

274
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,760
world

275
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,220
this bowhead whale will feed several
families throughout the season

276
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,530
and perhaps the polar bears as well

277
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,30
it's a cycle of life has remained

278
00:26:16,30 --> 00:26:18,889
unchanged for thousands of years

279
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,490
the

280
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,830
other whales will continue their annual
migration

281
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,949
following the open leads East to this
summer grounds

282
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,150
in the Beaufort Sea

283
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,000
to the ice is too thin for us to go any
further

284
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,620
it's late May and the pack ice is slowly
retreating

285
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:47,620
right now

286
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,470
it certainly feels treacherous out here
there are no shortcuts in the Arctic

287
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,980
you have to know when to call it quits
is Dale often says

288
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,620
if you don't come back this season you
can't hunt next season

289
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,379
it's a good lesson

290
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,380
even for a polar bear up

291
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,720
but continually having to haul himself
onto the ice takes an immense amount of

292
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,280
energy

293
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,50
polar bears face this challenge every
spring

294
00:27:39,50 --> 00:27:42,810
for the impacts have a warming world

295
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:49,810
made matters worse

296
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:58,340
losses pack ice is estimated at 11
percent per decade

297
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,480
the Bears fragile hunting platform is
getting fed

298
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,950
in this mother and cover found
themselves

299
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,440
in ocean

300
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,580
melting ice

301
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,30
and if warming trends continued seems
like this

302
00:28:23,30 --> 00:28:30,30
will become common

303
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,969
like many animals that have made such
great leaps in their revolution to

304
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,730
survive

305
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:49,730
the world may be changing too fast for
polar bears to keep up with

306
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,170
while the endless Arctic zones slowly
erodes the ice

307
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:01,580
the brings renewed life to the tundra

308
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,90
and the season the grisly is only just
begun

309
00:29:04,90 --> 00:29:06,389
I'll

310
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,140
it's the perfect time to head south and
into the heart of the Brooks Range

311
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,49
I

312
00:29:13,49 --> 00:29:20,49
he sparred

313
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,710
were following the trails have great
migrations from seasons past

314
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,730
house trails right on the mountains

315
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,899
right now runs filing tax

316
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,738
and we're hoping these caribou tracks
will point the way to Arctic Grizzlies

317
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:45,739
maybe our best chance at a closer look
at this elusive predator

318
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,330
but finding nearly half a million
caribou in the fastness have the western

319
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,999
Arctic

320
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:57,409
takes patience and persistence which pic
2 spot because his caribou trails for

321
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,49
around down I the valley

322
00:29:59,49 --> 00:30:02,850
each side of the 10 here no single
carrier

323
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,928
and no single bear book hopefully when
the Carrboro for security in big numbers

324
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:11,370
and as my right as well that's what
we're hoping for

325
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,350
within list to the aid of aerial
cameramen Daniels at

326
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,719
to help document the herd and hopefully
the Bears if we find them

327
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,110
so based on what Jim from fishing game
said he said that

328
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,258
the females in caps are running along
this line here to the north okay and

329
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:33,210
this is also where he expects will see
the Bears but it's really

330
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,450
unpredictable it's completely unprepared
caribou

331
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:43,450
you never know where they're going to go

332
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,970
on caribou are the ultimate Wanderers

333
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,279
within a single year the western Arctic
heard all range across the quarter

334
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:00,279
at alaska an area the size of Montana

335
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:08,730
on def

336
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,580
make money

337
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,659
many of

338
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,860
unique

339
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,409
looks like we're in luck

340
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,450
we've just caught the tail end of a
massive heard

341
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:34,450
go well

342
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,949
we've just settle down a spot here

343
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,000
some trying to stay very quiet which you
saw so the weather on the horizon

344
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,850
because they're just so ever vigilant
uniform all Sanders the best

345
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,379
that's when the safety in numbers comes
from if you're eating you not watching

346
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:00,380
watching not eating so if you're in a
group you can do both

347
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,840
spring is carving season

348
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,779
a sore these newborns are just a few
days old

349
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:13,989
caribou cars can run with him hours are
being born

350
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:20,989
it's a matter of survival

351
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
newly born come home so most vulnerable
to predators

352
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,309
and they have to stay close to mama all
times

353
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:50,309
rules

354
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:57,390
I'm never far behind

355
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:04,619
this gray wolf is testing the herd

356
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:11,619
looking for any signs of weakness

357
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:22,650
he's joined by another from the pack

358
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,220
together they've cut the hood at home

359
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,500
but soon the herders regrouped

360
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,500
and the walls give up the chase

361
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,860
there's little rest for the home until
they complete their seasonal migration

362
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:02,709
to this summer range

363
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,890
carol was largely sustained by the
high-energy sugars found in Arctic

364
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,480
lichen

365
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,530
so prized is this plan

366
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,740
that many biologists believe the
availability of lichen

367
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:20,739
during the winter months can profoundly
impact caribou numbers

368
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,600
well caribou this landscape would look
the way it does aerate the soil says

369
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,929
they're walking to make it more
productive plants

370
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:40,639
even their hair provides nesting
material for migratory birds around here

371
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,60
you can imagine how much fertilizer
half-a-million camera to create

372
00:34:45,60 --> 00:34:49,110
like blood vessels

373
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:56,110
flowing across this giant landscape

374
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:03,780
on

375
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,780
ok number three cups

376
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,390
the spring comes in the first year of
life foraging along the hillside

377
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:21,100
Arctic Grizzlies must make the most of
the short summers

378
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,540
and that includes is mating pair to
somehow found each other in this

379
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,90
vast expanse Grizzlies must cover

380
00:35:32,90 --> 00:35:36,40
great distances just to find enough food

381
00:35:36,40 --> 00:35:41,490
an Arctic grisly in open tundra can have
a home range the sizeof yellowstone

382
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,430
what you touch down

383
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:52,430
keeping up with the grisly is nearly
impossible

384
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:08,490
for the caribou their journey is nearly
over

385
00:36:09,30 --> 00:36:13,250
the herd is finally made it to this
summer range the completion

386
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,150
have their journey but caribou a
wonderous

387
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:24,150
and they don't stay put for long

388
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,38
with the herd moving on and only
fleeting glimpses

389
00:36:31,39 --> 00:36:38,39
Grizzlies we are left with few choices

390
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,569
an old report to the salmon run has
given us some hope

391
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,430
him back in

392
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,930
what but this far inland

393
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:58,640
it's a long shot even if we find someone
in the river

394
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,640
no 1 I've spoken with has actually seen
Arctic Grizzlies fishing

395
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,850
to caribou taunt me but it's not them on
looking for

396
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:27,850
your finding best time is the priority
here

397
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,850
British Grizzlies are around it's best
to be prepared

398
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,670
carry a shotgun only as an extreme
precautions

399
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,610
and believe it or not they really
popular thing we currently position

400
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,20
traditional route

401
00:37:49,20 --> 00:37:52,700
the lovely stuff on surprises morsels
been left behind

402
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,89
actual my look at this place in think he
doesn't offer very much

403
00:37:56,90 --> 00:38:00,730
for pieced together a diet little bit by
little bit they get by here

404
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:07,560
trucks or through here

405
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,180
look at this fresh grizzly bear tracks

406
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,549
I'm right in front of it caribou track

407
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,140
so both the species using this river to
get from A to B

408
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,190
and occasionally for bears lucky we have
to prey on the character especially

409
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,810
during

410
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:30,810
carving season

411
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:37,230
wow look at that the salmon a running

412
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,869
the question is

413
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:48,869
where the Bears

414
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:56,20
the time for a cuppa coffee I think

415
00:38:56,20 --> 00:38:59,119
after hours of waiting there's a shadow

416
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,119
moving through the willows

417
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,119
own yeah right

418
00:39:20,50 --> 00:39:27,50
as a third cup coming up the river cast
here

419
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,359
she's crossing here I do not want to
surprise his paddle

420
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,240
Arctic Grizzlies have a much more
aggressive reputations and coastal brown

421
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,890
bears

422
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,930
she seems pretty cool she seen us

423
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,69
just finding one would be chanson of

424
00:39:46,69 --> 00:39:49,490
how far back as the third one right
behind the second

425
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,970
okay the fourth one is way back there in
the Willows

426
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,578
on this side of the creek but now

427
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:04,579
we suddenly surrounded by four

428
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,840
the family seems to be using the river
is a corridor

429
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,400
but their food

430
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,400
is buried in the tundra

431
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,600
hey serum group are an important source
of protein for Arctic Grizzlies

432
00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:01,808
the Bears lack of interest in the salmon
is puzzling but the charm sermon don't

433
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,650
have nearly the fat and calories as does
the bears eat along the coast

434
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,190
once they leave the salt water to head
upstream

435
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,479
they stop eating all the energy goes
into reaching the spawning ground where

436
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:17,749
they were born

437
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:22,279
for these fish that's roughly 400 river
miles

438
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,890
it after weeks of swimming upstream

439
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,150
they've used a tremendous amount of
their reserves to get here

440
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,130
and the ones vibrant color has faded
from their skin

441
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,910
males will gather and fight for position

442
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,940
females arise good

443
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,959
West is courting process starts

444
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,799
it can take hours or even days to
complete

445
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,800
it

446
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,529
the family has returned

447
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,880
but this time they staked out a spot on
the river

448
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,880
mom is completely focused fishing

449
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,950
she's landed a huge

450
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:33,950
chum salmon

451
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,490
the whole family retreats into the
Willows to share the fish

452
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,330
here in the Arctic a catch like this is
quite a bounty

453
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:49,000
mom quickly returns to the river's edge

454
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,10
the Cubs will pick this fish clean

455
00:42:55,10 --> 00:43:01,720
while mom looks for more

456
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,980
comes

457
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:09,980
all lined up waiting for mom to catch
dinner

458
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,579
she's quickly proving to be a skilled
Fisher and by the looks at these Cubs

459
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,599
she's been an excellent provided for the
first two and a half years of their

460
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:49,319
lives

461
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,460
it's hard it's hard to even imagine what
comes

462
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,39
they're almost as big as she is at best
a the Cubs have been watching her

463
00:43:57,39 --> 00:43:57,799
closely

464
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:02,490
and now instead of feasting off what
she's cool they seem to be

465
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:09,490
interested in learning to fish
themselves

466
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,960
these new experiences show off how
different each of these comes I'll

467
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,960
they're all individuals this cop has
plenty of confidence

468
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,689
he's borderline troublesome one close
enough that's close enough

469
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,300
as close to North

470
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,750
okay it's alright UK

471
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,260
it's alright he ventures much further
than the other two

472
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:49,150
and seems to be quite bold this boldness
concerns his mom quite a bit

473
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:55,830
but it's also what heals him his first
catch

474
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,990
once created the lovable Panda

475
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:05,330
yeah

476
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:12,330
when he catches something it's his alone
he is already showing his independence

477
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,90
the other two cubs more plush and cub
liked in their brother

478
00:45:19,90 --> 00:45:22,130
one is playful

479
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:28,249
anxious as the bounds into the water
after fish the other copies

480
00:45:28,249 --> 00:45:35,249
much more cautious sticking close to mom

481
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,140
for the first time in the days we've
been watching her she's able to rest

482
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,520
comfortably on the shore

483
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,190
while the cops patrol the shallow River

484
00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:00,190
it's doubtful they know this is their
last summer under her care and guidance

485
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:17,979
at last smallest colby is beginning to
focus on the salmon

486
00:46:19,10 --> 00:46:26,10
mom follows close behind stirring up the
fish

487
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,879
she gives up the chase letting her come
finish to catch

488
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,880
are attacks

489
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,279
it's not uncommon to see a mother get
very protective and aggressive while

490
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,890
fishing

491
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:51,60
to me she seems intent on preparing
these cops for life on their own

492
00:46:51,60 --> 00:46:58,60
as she does with finding food though for
your way here

493
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,270
after several days is being watched

494
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,869
her curiosity for ross has finally
peaked

495
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:10,590
a where you are a good mama all you are
so sweet

496
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,000
look at her backing up like that

497
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
we're gonna get out of your way

498
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,549
that's our cue

499
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,000
will take a cue from this a good lesson
for us to keep in mind is to always

500
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,350
leave on a good note

501
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,529
while it may be some time before they
come across people again

502
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:43,300
when they do we won their memory of us

503
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:50,300
to be a positive one

504
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,140
with a few short hops

505
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:04,140
she rounds up her family to call it a
day

506
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,990
really didn't know when we entered this
situation if she was going to be

507
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,799
accepting a bus or not and she's emerged
to be this wise

508
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,920
mature d for careful female

509
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,450
it's taken us time to get to know them

510
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,960
to understand that so that we know what
their limits on and it reminds you that

511
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,960
any two bears are as different as any
two people you might in Kent

512
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,750
and over this journey it's become clear

513
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,30
the world these bears inhabit is

514
00:48:41,30 --> 00:48:44,350
fast getting must remain so

515
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:51,350
to sustain such great wonders

516
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,460
the resources we so prized are embedded
in the land that sustains all

517
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,570
life here

518
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,100
like the great plains of Africa

519
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,420
Alaska is the last stronghold for summer
the

520
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:15,390
us wildest creatures

521
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:19,810
I've never felt so comfortable also a
life is like to hear

522
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,970
this may be the end of my journey but
Alaska's wilderness

523
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,89
its wildest creatures

524
00:49:28,90 --> 00:49:35,90
always call me back
