1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,59
George Plafker: "Everything was in chaos..."

2
00:00:12,59 --> 00:00:15,530
Art Grantz: "I'd never seen anything that
destructive that close up ..."

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,490
Narrator:
In 1964, Alaska was shaken by the largest

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:26,490
U.S. earthquake ever recorded:
Magnitude 9.2.

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:35,390
Narrator:
Shaking went on for over four minutes.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,890
One hundred forty three people died. Total
property loss in 2013 dollars is estimated

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:48,890
at 2.3 billion. There were gaping fractures,
massive landslides, and the destruction of

8
00:00:49,10 --> 00:00:54,300
water mains, gas, sewer, telephone and electrical
systems.

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,919
Narrator:
The epicenter was in Prince William Sound,

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,920
74 miles southeast of Anchorage. Yet effects
were observed as far away as Texas and Louisiana.

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,39
What the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake taught
scientists was as profound and far-reaching.

12
00:01:11,39 --> 00:01:16,640
Narrator:
Initially, no one understood how or why the

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,590
earthquake occurred.
Immediately, three U.S. Geological Survey

14
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,110
scientists were sent to figure it out.

15
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,520
George Plafker: "The main airport, the Anchorage
International, was closed down because the

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,710
control tower had collapsed and killed the
operator."

17
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,729
Arthur Grantz: "... we went out separately,
mostly separately, to look at different things

18
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,659
so
we could cover three times as much ground..."

19
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,240
Narrator:
The scientists studied the effects from the

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,869
air, on land, and along shorelines. They were
astonished to find that the surface was disrupted

21
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,369
over an area larger than California -- 185,000
square miles.

22
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:58,490
Some areas dropped down as much as 8 feet,
and others rose up by as much as 38 feet....

23
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,949
barnacles once two feet below the ocean surface
were suddenly several feet above.

24
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,700
Narrator:
Mapping this uplift and down-drop became crucial

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,750
for understanding what happened. But, with
no faults visible at the surface to explain

26
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,560
it....even with months of careful observation
and field work the cause of the quake remained

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,269
a mystery.

28
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,950
Peter Haeussler:
"It was right at this time that this idea

29
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,929
of plate tectonics, that the surface of the
earth is broken up into roughly a dozen different

30
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,819
plates and that they move around with respect
to each other. It occurred right at the time

31
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,10
when this idea was being put forth."

32
00:02:34,10 --> 00:02:38,230
Narrator:
One of the scientists, geologist George Plafker,

33
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,49
considered the quake in terms of this newly-forming
theory of plate tectonics.

34
00:02:43,50 --> 00:02:47,819
He knew the theory had new crust forming at
mid-ocean ridges but there was no explanation

35
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,329
for where this crust went.

36
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,40
George Plafker:
"And so the most likely one, we could, came

37
00:02:52,40 --> 00:02:58,90
to mind was that the oceanic crust is being
pushed underneath that part of southern Alaska

38
00:02:58,90 --> 00:03:04,430
at a very low angle and there was slip on
this, on the interface between the oceanic

39
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,60
crust and the overlying continental crust."

40
00:03:07,60 --> 00:03:10,110
Narrator:
These two crusts are converging at the rate

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,330
of an inch and a half each year. Periodic
slip between the crusts produces great quakes,

42
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,129
which Plafker called Megathrust earthquakes.

43
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,230
Narrator:
His realization changed our understanding

44
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,690
of these great earthquakes.
Megathrust quakes are the largest known on

45
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,109
planet Earth. They occur in areas of colliding
and descending crusts known today as subduction

46
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,830
zones.

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,129
Narrator:
The uplift and down drop of large areas from

48
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:42,709
these quakes is a result of the crust being
compressed over years of the plates converging...it

49
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,680
releases like a spring - which is the earthquake...Seaward
areas are uplifted while landward areas drop

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,879
down. George Plafker identified this pattern
common to megathrust quakes in subduction

51
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,319
zones.

52
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,988
Peter Haeussler:
"The 1964 earthquake was the first megathrust

53
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,930
subduction zone earthquake properly interpreted
as such. As a result of that, essentially,

54
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,659
every other large subduction zone earthquake
around the world sort of falls in the shadow

55
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,379
of what we learned from the 1964 earthquake
."

56
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,939
Narrator:
Next, the question became:

57
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,289
"How often do these quakes happen?"

58
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,579
George Plafker:
"One of the obvious things that everybody

59
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,550
wants to know when you have an earthquake
like this is how frequently do they occur?

60
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,270
Could you have one tomorrow or is it thousands
of years?

61
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,109
Narrator:
Plafker and his team drilled 50 feet into

62
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,740
the earth and collected core samples to find
out. They used carbon dating to identify when

63
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,800
past megathrust earthquakes have occurred
in south central Alaska.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,90
George Plafker:
"... it's just an example of what has happened

65
00:04:44,90 --> 00:04:51,90
in the past and the analog for that is what
happened in the 1964 earthquake, namely abrupt

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,520
uplift of a broad area of mudflats that are
intertidal and then sudden appearance of fresh

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,800
water plants growing on that surface.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,330
Narrator:
In the cores, where the remains of land plants

69
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,639
overly ocean sediments this marks a moment
of sudden change...a past megathrust quake.

70
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,810
Dating the plant remains provides an age for
that quake.

71
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,990
Narrator:
The team discovered nine megathrust earthquakes

72
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,30
have occurred in south central Alaska over
the past 5,500 years. The average time span

73
00:05:26,30 --> 00:05:29,780
between these quakes is was 630 years.

74
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,539
Narrator:
Another devastating effect of the 1964 Great

75
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,240
Alaska Earthquake was a series of deadly tsunamis.
The largest, triggered by the shifting of

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,110
plates when the quake began ... traveled across
the Pacific, wreaking havoc in coastal Oregon,

77
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,960
California, Hawaii and beyond.

78
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Narrator:
Locally, a number of extremely dangerous tsunamis

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,590
occurred in south central Alaska fjords like
Whittier and Valdez. Most deaths resulting

80
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,698
from the 1964 quake came from these local
tsunamis in fjords. The scientists recognized

81
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,50
that these were produced by underwater landslides
that occurred as the quake began.

82
00:06:13,50 --> 00:06:17,630
Peter Haeussler:
In the 1964 earthquake, of the people who

83
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,580
died, most people were killed by tsunamis.
And there's kind of two ways you can make

84
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,289
tsunamis, but the way that the tsunamis were
made right here in Whittier was by underwater

85
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,139
landslides. ... there is material at the edges
of these fjords here and then it's shaken

86
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,990
in the earthquake and then it slides downward
into the deep part of the fjord, that generates

87
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,69
tsunami waves which then hit the shoreline.
And the thing that's really notable about

88
00:06:42,69 --> 00:06:46,910
those kinds of tsunamis is that they hit the
shoreline very soon after the beginning of

89
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,319
shaking... and so here in Whittier the first
tsunami wave was really well observed, out

90
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,310
in the middle of the fjord, but within three
minutes there were three waves that covered

91
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,639
a large part of Whittier. And it killed about
12 people. There was a lumber mill located

92
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,590
about where that hotel is in the background
there - there were 13 deaths in Whittier and

93
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,880
12 of them were over there."

94
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,460
Narrator:
Chenega, a small native village in Prince

95
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,419
William Sound, lost 23 people -- a third of
its population.

96
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,990
Narrator:
Today, scientists use ocean-bottom sonar mapping

97
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,569
to identify submarine landslide deposits from
the past. Additional work like coring and

98
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:35,150
dating these slides will help refine understanding
of the tsunami hazard and how often these

99
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,840
quakes occur.

100
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,900
Peter Haeussler:
...and at Valdez in particular, it looks like

101
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,719
there may be like six to ten of these big
underwater landslide deposits at depth. So,

102
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,360
we know that these kinds of things happen
over and over again. Ya know, here we are

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,539
at the margin of a fjord, we've got these
big mountains there's glaciers and streams

104
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,680
eroding these things, they're putting sediment
at the margins of the fjord . We have the

105
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,139
megathrust underneath us here at about 12
to 15 miles depth and these big earthquakes

106
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,280
it shakes like crazy releases these sediments
into the deep parts of the fjord and then

107
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,000
generates tsunamis. So, if you're living at
the edge of a fjord, or recreating and an

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,419
earthquake happens, a really important thing
to do is to travel to high ground right away.

109
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,818
You don't want to wait to hear a tsunami alarm
or anything like that. If you feel strong

110
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,379
shaking that feels like a strong earthquake
you need to head uphill right away. Don't

111
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,800
wait until the earthquake is over."

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,510
Narrator:
Some of the most stunning destruction from

113
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,49
the 1964 quake came from sub-aerial landslides.
Extreme shaking led to significant ground

114
00:08:44,49 --> 00:08:50,189
failure and liquefaction in Anchorage. Massive
landslides struck the downtown area, Government

115
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,209
Hill, and in the Turnagain-By-The Sea subdivision.

116
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,979
Peter Haeussler:
... what happened is through the ground shaking

117
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,430
in the 64 earthquake there were these blocks
that sort of slid sideways as a result of

118
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,790
that... and then some buildings collapsed
into those areas, sometimes the edge of a

119
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,599
building was sticking off where it had failed
underneath there. There were a few people

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,980
killed as a result of the damage to these
buildings in the 64 earthquake.

121
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,230
Narrator:
The widespread damage and loss of life from

122
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,29
this earthquake led to a determination to
use science to save lives in the future.

123
00:09:25,29 --> 00:09:28,450
Legacies from the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake
include:

124
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,510
-- The establishment of the USGS Earthquake
Hazards Program.

125
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,639
-- NOAA's round-the-clock Tsunami Warning
Centers.

126
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,980
-- New building codes and innovations in retrofitting
older, vulnerable structures.

127
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,790
As part of the Advanced National Seismic System,
the USGS now routinely monitors all earthquakes

128
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,829
that occur in the U.S.

129
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,830
Peter Haeussler:
"South central Alaska here is the infrastructure

130
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,649
center of the state and it's also by far the
largest population center in the state. And

131
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,500
the work that we do involves basically the
fundamental characterizing of the earthquake

132
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,550
hazard and knowing which faults are active,
which faults can produce earthquakes, understanding

133
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,160
how often those earthquakes occur...and then
another part is understanding the local tsunami

134
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,560
hazard. And getting an idea of how often they
occur and doing tsunami modeling to understand

135
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,50
where people could be hit by these tsunamis."

136
00:10:30,50 --> 00:10:33,490
Narrator:
All together, these programs can help predict

137
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,269
strong ground motions from future earthquakes,
and minimize risks. For example, scientists

138
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,779
learned that Valdez was so unstable and at
such risk for earthquakes that the entire

139
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,970
town was moved.

140
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,360
Narrator:
In recent years, megathrust quakes in subduction

141
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,240
zones... accompanied by tsunamis have occurred
in Indonesia, Japan and Chile.

142
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,950
Narrator:
The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake changed our

143
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,450
understanding of earthquakes and tsunamis
...... and had a profound and lasting impact

144
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:13,450
on how scientific knowledge can be used to
help reduce risks and save lives.

145
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,730
