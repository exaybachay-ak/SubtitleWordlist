1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,799
I’m going to die.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Time is running out for me, and for my companions;

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,80
my brothers of the river who, like me, were born in these waters four years ago.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,240
Our lives are coming to an end after a long, dangerous journey.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,000
But we have made it here, to the place where we first emerged into the world,

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,440
the place we have chosen to die.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,480
Our beloved Alaska. 

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,000
It is a harsh, wild place.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,680
A land of dense forests and cold tundras,

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,760
 crossed by innumerable rivers that are born in the distant mountains of the interior

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,240
and come to die here, on these frozen coasts.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,560
We left these waters some time ago, when we were still young

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,000
and now, we have returned to swim from the sea back up our rivers. 

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,760
An epic journey, plagued with dangers. 

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,800
But that is part of our destiny, part of our greatness. 

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,520
In a land as harsh as this, which gives you no second chances,

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,320
our arrival is the key to the continuity of life. 

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
Before we die, we will leave behind, on the river bed, 

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,80
the seed of future generations of salmon.

20
00:02:01,80 --> 00:02:05,840
And at the end of our long journey, our old but nutritious bodies 

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,600
will serve as food for the large animals of this land, 

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,160
fattening them up, giving them the reserves they need to survive the terrible Arctic winter.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,280
Yes, I’m going to die,

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,200
 but allow me, in these final minutes, to tell you the story of our lives,

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,799
our odyssey in the distant land of the giant bears. 

26
00:03:03,80 --> 00:03:06,240
In the far north-west of the American continent 

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,400
stretches a land some one and a half million square kilometres in size. 

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,560
Only six hundred thousand people inhabit this region where the frozen tundra,

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,720
the coniferous forests and the mountains dominate a landscape

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,960
which, in some places, has never been trodden by man.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,440
It is an inhospitable region, where life must make the maximum advantage of the few warm months, 

32
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,200
after which the cold and the snow will once more take over the land.

33
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,680
And nonetheless, such is the natural wealth of Alaska 

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,760
that over 50% of all the protected territory of the United States of America can be found here. 

35
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,400
Its waters are full of krill, the small crustaceans that forms the basic diet of many marine animals. 

36
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,839
Such a delicious feast that every summer the hunchback whales

37
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,560
 travel over three thousand miles from the warm waters of Hawaii 

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,440
in order to eat their fill.

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,120
And only the cold forces them to return to the south.

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,40
They are not the only summer visitors.

41
00:04:50,40 --> 00:04:55,480
In a land dominated by ice few species can survive the hardships of winter. 

42
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:03,200
When the cold sets in, food becomes scarce, and hibernation or emigration are the only possible alternatives.

43
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,320
 The only thing that grows in the winter are the glaciers high up in the mountains. 

44
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,680
The snows feed the glacier valleys and their gigantic tongues of ice 

45
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,360
can advance a few more centimetres on their slow descent to the sea. 

46
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,440
For thousands of years they were the real masters of Alaska. 

47
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,320
The entire land was covered in ice, allowing no life to enter its domains.

48
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,640
 Today, however, this supremacy has been challenged,

49
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,680
and each spring the ice it´s once more defeated. 

50
00:06:36,40 --> 00:06:40,360
Little by little the surface of the land is covered in blocks of ice

51
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,800
which began their slow journey towards the sea over a thousand years ago.

52
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,240
The start of the melt announces the resurgence of life in Alaska. 

53
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,920
At the feet of the giant the seals doze in the sun before diving into the freezing cold waters in search of food. 

54
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Nature forges her way ahead at the very gates of the titan of ice.

55
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,320
From this time on the land undergoes a rapid transformation

56
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,000
With the increase in temperature, the layer of snow that had covered the landscape shrinks back 

57
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,600
and the vegetation begins a race against the clock to complete its life cycle

58
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
in the few available months. 

59
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,400
With the vegetation, food returns, and the largest of Alaska’s land carnivores, 

60
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,280
the grizzly bear, awakes from its winter sleep. 

61
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,440
	Five months spent in the darkness in his den

62
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,920
Five months of fasting which are now coming to an end.

63
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,120
For the first time in many months, precipitation falls in the form of rain, 

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,400
announcing the change of season, and the new-grown prairies fill with hungry bears. 

65
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,199
They have spent the winter breastfeeding their cubs while themselves observing a strict fast.

66
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,760
Summer is short and it is essential to regain those lost kilos

67
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,40
if they hope to survive another year. 

68
00:08:52,40 --> 00:08:55,839
In Alaska, svelte figures don’t last for long. 

69
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,480
The grizzly bear belongs to the same species as the European brown bear, 

70
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,520
but its better diet enables it to grow much bigger.

71
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,40
A Pyrenean bear weighs around 300 kilos and stands two metres tall, 

72
00:09:15,40 --> 00:09:21,400
while on Kodiak island some bears can weigh almost 1,000 kilos and measure 3 metres.

73
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,240
The cubs remain with their mother for three years, after which their life of solitude begins. 

74
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,280
From that time on, they will receive neither protection nor help, 

75
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,560
and the companions they had played with up to now will become their rivals. 

76
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,800
The grizzlies are solitary animals, and at the start of spring hunger makes them even more dangerous.

77
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,520
So, when an adult male approaches a group of young bears,

78
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,160
 they know it’s time to stop their games and make a rapid getaway. 

79
00:10:32,40 --> 00:10:38,280
In times of hunger the adult bears are capable of killing and eating young of their own species, 

80
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,240
so it’s probably best to take no chances.

81
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,960
The climate has also determined the vegetation of Alaska. 

82
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,320
Wherever temperatures permit, the land is covered with coniferous forest.

83
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Their small leaves, the needles, are not shed in the winter,

84
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,240
which permits them to take advantage of the warmer months from the very first day. 

85
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,000
And this they do so effectively they block out almost all the light.

86
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Except for the moss that covers the forest floor,

87
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,920
 few plants are capable of living in their shade

88
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,680
The trees with deciduous leaves, less well adapted to the cold, 

89
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,880
have to take refuge along the shores of the rivers and in the more protected areas,

90
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,240
 and that is where the large herbivores go in search of them.

91
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,280
The spring brings fresh vegetation, an irresistible feast for any moose. 

92
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,360
Like the bears, they are solitary animals.

93
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,240
The only groups outside the mating season are mothers with their young, 

94
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,360
and these are precisely the most dangerous because the mother will allow no one, 

95
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
not even one of her own species, 

96
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
to get close to her young.

97
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,40
An absent-minded moose has come to drink at the same pool, unaware of her presence. 

98
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,480
The calf doesn’t seem to mind the intruder, but its mother does not exactly welcome visitors

99
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
and it’s not long before she approaches the stranger to make her position clear. 

100
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,160
There have been cases of female moose killing people who got too close to her young.

101
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,839
In a land of bears and wolves, the most dangerous animals of all are, paradoxically, the moose. 

102
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The unwitting intruder knows this, and moves off in search of quieter pastures.

103
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,880
No one, not even the large males, would dare challenge a mother, 

104
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,000
and even less for a bit of water or a few willow leaves.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,40
The deciduous plants, in contrast to the conifers, shed their leaves during the winter,

106
00:13:51,40 --> 00:13:55,599
 and in a land as cold as this that creates real problems.

107
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,280
 When warmer weather arrives they have to waste precious time growing new leaves, 

108
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,199
which reduces their summer to the minimum. 

109
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,960
And that without counting the herbivores or the most feared enemy of all, 

110
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,600
the leaf-eating caterpillars. 

111
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,840
Hidden by the leaf itself, the tiny caterpillars feed on the internal tissue,

112
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,400
 robbing the plant of its food factories, the photosynthetic cells. 

113
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,520
With luck, the birch will lose only part of its foliage,

114
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 but if the attack is widespread it will die. 

115
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,79
The good weather does not last long enough to produce new leaves to replace the damaged ones. 

116
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,360
 The same climatic conditions that give the conifers a considerable advantage over the deciduous trees 

117
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,40
are also a determining factor in Alaska’s animal life

118
00:15:04,40 --> 00:15:09,240
Many species, such as this bald eagle, have given birth to their young during the spring 

119
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,520
and have to make sure they complete their development before the winter freeze returns. 

120
00:15:25,40 --> 00:15:31,160
To achieve this in so little time, the fauna needs a source of food the land is simply unable to give them.

121
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,40
But what Alaska doesn’t have it receives every year, just at the right time, from the sea. 

122
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,80
As the summer advances, the grizzly bears leave the pasture 

123
00:15:55,80 --> 00:15:58,800
to visit the shores where this manna from heaven is about to arrive.

124
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,839
With all the calm in the world they walk along the river bank, examining it for food.

125
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,760
But this year, the gift from the sea is a little late in coming. 

126
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,560
For the time being the only food around is algae and the odd dead fish.

127
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,160
 Nothing vaguely interesting for their empty stomachs.

128
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,40
After sniffing around in the sand for something to eat, 

129
00:16:38,40 --> 00:16:40,319
the male understands it’s still early. 

130
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,400
It might be a long wait, 

131
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,800
so the best thing you can do is make yourself comfortable and dig yourself a good seat in the soft sand. 

132
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
And now all that’s required is a little patience.

133
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,640
He was the first to arrive, but he’s not the only that comes to the coast.

134
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,000
 Soon, he will be joined by another adult male with similar intentions, 

135
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,720
and the disputes will begin to determine who gets the best spot along the shore. 

136
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,000
The loser doesn’t have to move far. 

137
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,240
Just a few metres away, he goes back to padding around in search of food.

138
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,400
It won’t be long before these two are accompanied by other bears who, 

139
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,680
like them, have abandoned the grasslands, and now impatiently examine the water. 

140
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,920
All of them are waiting for the salmon to arrive, their only hope in this cold, hostile land.

141
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,400
 Each year thousands of salmon return to the rivers where they were born,

142
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,920
 providing the local wildlife with the food they need to build up the reserves necessary

143
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,200
to survive the long, harsh winter. 

144
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,640
They are manna from the sea, the reserves of protein and fat everyone is waiting for. 

145
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,720
The salmon, quite simply, are life. 

146
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,399
The role of the salmon is so important that even those species that don’t eat them are affected by the phenomenon. 

147
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,520
These are sea otters, one of the few sea mammals that remain along the coast of Alaska all year round. 

148
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,240
They are relatives of the river otter, but unlike them, the sea otters spend 90% of their lives in the water. 

149
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,000
There, they eat, sleep, reproduce, and even give birth to their young.

150
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,560
  The air trapped in their fur helps them to float,

151
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,80
but it also provides insulation against the cold, essential this far north.

152
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,439
Thanks to this, they can float on their backs, 

153
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,520
their favourite posture, while they eat, sleep or simply play. 

154
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,880
They have been a protected species for many years,

155
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,600
 but still their numbers are now declining, due in part to the salmon.

156
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,40
Salmon are not the basic diet of the otters, 

157
00:20:27,40 --> 00:20:31,80
but they do attract the seals and sea lions, which come to Alaska every year.

158
00:20:31,80 --> 00:20:38,199
And they, in turn are the favourite food of the largest predator in the ocean: the orca. 

159
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,000
So, when salmon are scarce, the seals and sea lions have fewer young, 

160
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,280
and when there are not many seals, sea lions and salmon around, 

161
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,600
the orcas have to find an alternative source of food: 

162
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,879
the otters. 

163
00:21:01,80 --> 00:21:05,520
The habitats of Alaska are both complex and fragile,

164
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,000
the result of the extreme conditions and thousands of years of evolution.

165
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,960
And any change, however small it may appear, can cause irreparable damage.

166
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,640
This delay in the arrival of the salmon can, itself, bring severe consequences. 

167
00:21:31,40 --> 00:21:37,480
It’s now the end of June, the salmon have still not arrived, and many animals are starting to get impatient. 

168
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,920
Day after day they enter the estuaries of the rivers in the hope of seeing the tireless travellers. 

169
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,360
And day after day they return to their rocks empty-handed.

170
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,40
Alongside them, on a tiny nearby island, the colony of puffins seems much calmer.

171
00:22:02,40 --> 00:22:04,440
 They too have specialised in fishing,

172
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,400
 but their prey is much smaller than the salmon. 

173
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,600
For them, the herring are their own particular feast

174
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,439
and this year fishing will be plentiful. 

175
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,879
While the puffins are hard at work fishing, 

176
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
on the neighbouring island the seals and sea lions continue their wait. 

177
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Both species arrived at the start of the summer in order to reproduce. 

178
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,679
They came with plenty of fat reserves, because the males don’t eat during the breeding season 

179
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,160
and the females have to breastfeed their young, which is an additional drain on  their resources. 

180
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:03,480
For them, the arrival of the salmon means an incredible source of energy just at the time they most need it. 

181
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,800
The low temperature of the water means they need a layer of fat to protect them from the cold.

182
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,200
 But, if food is scarce, the sea lions, like the seals, 

183
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,280
will be forced to stop breastfeeding their young and return to their winter habitats. 

184
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,000
The pups acquire this layer of fat during lactation,

185
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,120
so if their mothers have to return early they will not be ready to face the journey and will die.

186
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,600
This problem has already arisen in Alaska, and has forced the law courts to place a ban on trawl net fishing in the area

187
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,679
 in order to save these colonies of marine mammals. 

188
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,40
At last, there is a sign from the sea: orcas. 

189
00:24:09,40 --> 00:24:14,240
For once, their worst enemies are a reason to rejoice, as they come in pursuit of the salmon. 

190
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,400
Still, it would be a good idea to wait a little longer before diving into the banquet.

191
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,800
 The orcas are still in the vicinity

192
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:36,480
 and if they spot the sea lions they might just decide it’s time to change the menu and try a little meat instead of fish. 

193
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,920
After several years out in the ocean, the five species of salmon that live in the rivers of Alaska return home.

194
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,160
 Millions of them approach the coast, heading for the same watercourse in which they were born,

195
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,600
 in order to carry out their final mission to perpetuate the species. 

196
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,280
The seals watch the orcas move off while the salmon begin their journey upriver.

197
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,440
The first ones are the most fortunate 

198
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,520
they have a little time while the seals make sure there is no danger before diving into the water. 

199
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,520
The salmon hunting season has begun. 

200
00:25:42,40 --> 00:25:45,399
The passage is very narrow, so it’s very easy for the seals. 

201
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,320
All they have to do is wait near the entrance for lunch to arrive. 

202
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
 For the salmon their own personal Calvary has just begun..

203
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,600
The water is teeming with fish, and the predators hardly need make an effort. 

204
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,840
But it is precisely their sheer numbers that enable the salmon to survive 

205
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,159
 for every one caught, hundreds of others manage to slip past and into the river. 

206
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,679
Finally, after the terror, the first rest. 

207
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,120
Protected by the narrowness of the entrance, the salmon remain at the river mouth while they adapt to this new medium. 

208
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,840
In a few days, they will make the transition from salt water to fresh water,

209
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,439
and in order to be able to tolerate this change, which would kill any other fish, 

210
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
their bodies have to undergo profound physiological transformations. 

211
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,440
Their nutritious bodies are also eagerly awaited inland, 

212
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,80
and when they arrive thousands of birds gather at the river mouths. 

213
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,400
The salmon have finally reached the land they originally came from,

214
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,920
 but their odyssey has just begun.

215
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:53,640
Now, they have to face seagulls, eagles, otters, and above all the great predator of Alaska, 

216
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,440
the largest land carnivore in the world

217
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,240
the grizzly 

218
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,600
Hundreds of bears will take up their places along the river banks,

219
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,439
eagerly awaiting the nutritious salmon. 

220
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,80
For weeks, they have been feeding on grasses and berries, waiting for them to arrive. 

221
00:28:26,80 --> 00:28:31,679
The time of abundance has finally arrived and they will be sure to make the most of it. 

222
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,400
The first days are the most intense. 

223
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,720
The fishing territories are not yet established and everyone wants the best place.

224
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,280
 Hunger and strength will decide who gets first choice.

225
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,160
In just a few days the rivers are full of salmon and hungry bears in search of food.

226
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,760
The large males have taken up the best positions, but the young ones are not so fortunate, 

227
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,400
and a group of them decides to try its luck in a nearby stream. 

228
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,879
It would seem to be the ideal place, and there’s no competition. 

229
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
But there is one problem

230
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,000
there are no salmon in the water.

231
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,440
They appear to have chosen the wrong stream. 

232
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,320
Sure enough, there are no salmon.

233
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,879
Each individual salmon returns to the same river in which it was born, 

234
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,680
and the proximity of two streams doesn’t mean there will be salmon in both of them.

235
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,120
 Until they arrive, the young bears will have to feed on crustaceans, 

236
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,879
larvae or other small animals hiding among the rocks on the bed of the stream. 

237
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,480
While the young bears continue to search for food, 

238
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,320
three new hungry mouths arrive at the nearby river 

239
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,639
a mother, accompanied by her two cubs.

240
00:30:49,40 --> 00:30:52,520
The bear cubs don’t seem to be very interested in fishing.

241
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,200
They’ve never known hard times. 

242
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,800
They’ve spent the entire winter feeding on their mother’s milk and their stomachs have never experienced hunger. 

243
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,520
The mother, in contrast, has spent months feeding her young and needs to regain her strength for the coming winter. 

244
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,280
With so much available food, the bears become less aggressive,

245
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,360
 but an adult male is always dangerous. 

246
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,000
Especially when there are cubs around.

247
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,560
The mother has smelt him and immediately goes on the alert.

248
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,280
The stranger is heading directly towards them, so the female decides to move off, 

249
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,560
and when the male makes a sharp movement she flees with her offspring. 

250
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,520
They will have to find a quieter river. 

251
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,800
The flow of salmon is influenced by the tides. 

252
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,919
At low tide, the current becomes stronger at the river mouth and this, combined with the reduced depth,

253
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,360
 means it is not the best time to enter the water. 

254
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:27,240
There are fewer salmon, and the predators take advantage to snooze or play on the beach revealed by the outgoing tide. 

255
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,959
Six hours later the process is reversed, 

256
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,160
and the sea returns to reclaim the land. 

257
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
With the conditions in their favour, the indefatigable travellers again set off on their journey home.

258
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,40
 A long time has passed since they descended these same waters on their way to the ocean.

259
00:33:17,40 --> 00:33:23,320
Today, they are finally returning to their origins, to once again complete the cycle of life.

260
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,600
Thanks to their chemical receptors, the equivalent of the sense of smell in humans,

261
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,439
while still out at sea they detected the waters of their own rivers, 

262
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,80
much like people differentiate one perfume from another. 

263
00:33:44,80 --> 00:33:49,960
And, guided by this, thousands of salmon dispersed across the Pacific Ocean

264
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,200
again gather at the same place they left years ago, 

265
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,200
the river where they first came into the world. 

266
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,680
Their bodies have now made the necessary changes.

267
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,840
Now, they can live in fresh water and are ready to face the next test, 

268
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,640
the ascent up the river.

269
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,520
The jaws of the males have grown longer and have developed sharp, ferocious teeth

270
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,920
which they will use to fight for the females.

271
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,120
 In some species, they have also acquired a characteristic hump. 

272
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,639
But the most important change is that in their gonads, their sexual glands. 

273
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,359
They have grown so much that they press against the stomach wall and prevent them from eating.

274
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:52,400
 They will have to conquer the rapids, leap up waterfalls and escape from their predators without eating a single thing. 

275
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,880
In the river they will have virtually no rest.

276
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:13,120
 Even along the calmest stretches the current drags back any who do not struggle against it, so constant effort is required. 

277
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,359
With no possibility of feeding, every lost minute reduces their precious reserves a little more. 

278
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,600
And so the journey upriver becomes a race against time.

279
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,959
Along the river the salmon will establish their spawning grounds.

280
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,880
Some of them will spawn near the river mouth,

281
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,560
 but others will have to travel hundreds of kilometres against strong currents 

282
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,759
before they reach their destination. 

283
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,40
And throughout the journey there will be predators trying to prevent them from ever reaching their goal. 

284
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,80
The salmon are Alaska’s particular staff of life, on which all other wildlife, directly or indirectly, depends. 

285
00:36:22,80 --> 00:36:25,560
Marine mammals, birds and land predators 

286
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,920
rely on this torrent of proteins and carbohydrates which every year sweeps across the land.

287
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,200
Their enormous reserves, accumulated in order to survive for weeks without eating,

288
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,960
will pass directly to the bodies of their assassins.

289
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,240
	Their only hope lies in sheer numbers. 

290
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,520
While the predator is occupied with one victim, 

291
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
others are able to escape and continue on their way. 

292
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,80
This incredible nutrition explains why the bears here are  the largest in the world. 

293
00:37:16,80 --> 00:37:24,240
Even within Alaska, those bears that live in the interior of the state and don’t have access to this manna are much smaller. 

294
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,240
Not every attempt is successful. 

295
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,359
But at this time of year it’s no problem if a salmon manages to escape.

296
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,000
After the first desperate days, and with their stomachs now full,

297
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,960
 the bears have become much more choosy, and carefully select their prey.

298
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,40
The females, for example, are full of tasty eggs, and a real delicacy.

299
00:37:59,40 --> 00:38:03,240
As the days advance, they reject more and more potential prey

300
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 and will accept only the most exquisite morsels offered by the river. 

301
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
No one is more grateful for this attitude than the seagulls.

302
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,80
Their food is served up on a plate, without them having to make the slightest effort. 

303
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,600
The number of dead bodies scattered along the river bank keeps on mounting,

304
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,000
 but the bears, seemingly oblivious, continue the massacre. 

305
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,920
As long as there are salmon in the river, they will not move far from the banks, 

306
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,920
and at each high tide they again come down to fish. 

307
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,40
Along the upper reaches, the shallower waters make fishing easier, 

308
00:39:16,40 --> 00:39:19,720
but the best places are those close to the river mouth. 

309
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,399
Here, the salmon arrive in their prime, their bodies full of nutritious fat. 

310
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,960
The bears know this, and so they concentrate downstream. 

311
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,520
The upper reaches are left for the younger ones, who can’t compete against the adults. 

312
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,880
On occasions, a brave young bear decides to try his luck alongside the adults

313
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,600
but here each one has his own territory and anyone who tries to invade it is quickly repelled.

314
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
It doesn’t make much sense to fight with so much food around,

315
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,000
and the intruder does not put up much resistance.

316
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,520
But he’s not resigned to leaving empty-handed. 

317
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,680
When no one is looking, he grabs a fish that has been thrown aside, 

318
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,000
and finally is able to enjoy a fat, juicy salmon. 

319
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,800
Though the bears continue to feed on the salmon, at this time of summer, fishing has become almost a game

320
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,960
 and they don’t even eat the majority of those they catch. 

321
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,40
The salmon that have been discarded then have a second chance, 

322
00:40:59,40 --> 00:41:01,520
if they can manage to get back to the water. 

323
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,279
When he is almost there, the predator stops him.

324
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,760
After mutilating the salmon, he lets it go and sets off in search of another victim, 

325
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
who will probably receive the same treatment. 

326
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,520
The wounded salmon will have virtually no chance of fulfilling their mission of procreating.

327
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,840
 The majority flap around in the river, exhausting what little strength they have left, 

328
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,800
in a vain attempt to reach their goal. 

329
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,200
And within days they will die at the hands of another bear or some other predator that crosses their path. 

330
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,120
A few weeks after they arrived, the rivers are like the scene of some terrible battle.

331
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,799
Along the riverbanks float hundreds of dying salmon,

332
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,880
and the bodies of those who were unable to survive this demanding test. 

333
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,759
he bears kill thousands of the incoming salmon. 

334
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,880
And many of them are simply discarded, without even taking a bite out of them. 

335
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,480
It would appear to be a senseless massacre.

336
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,760
 But in Alaska nothing goes to waste.

337
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,680
 Thousands of smaller predators and scavengers depend on the bears in order to be able to get at this source of energy

338
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,160
 brought by the sea every year. 

339
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,759
The salmon also benefit from this natural selection. 

340
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,40
The fact this test is so demanding means only the fittest will make it to the end.

341
00:43:23,40 --> 00:43:27,759
 Moreover, the number of salmon that come to these coasts every year is such that, 

342
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,400
if they all reached their final destination, the rivers would be saturated.

343
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:38,80
The last to arrive destroy eggs previously laid by others, and prepare their own nests right there. 

344
00:43:38,80 --> 00:43:43,560
The population needs to be controlled, and that is precisely the role the predators perform .

345
00:44:06,40 --> 00:44:09,520
Slowly, the travellers continue on their way upriver. 

346
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,560
They have left behind the majority of their enemies.

347
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,200
Now, they are not constantly under attack from the bears, 

348
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,279
but the current becomes stronger and stronger, and they are increasingly weak. 

349
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,759
Any calm stretch comes as a relief to their tired bodies. 

350
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,360
They have been days without eating, struggling against the current. 

351
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Now that they are weak, the seagulls become more daring, and mercilessly attack them.

352
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,799
 But they don’t defend themselves, all their energy is concentrated on continuing the journey,

353
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,200
 reaching the longed-for destination, and procreating. 

354
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,760
The majority of the rivers of Alaska subject the salmon to one final test. 

355
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,440
Those that don’t spawn near the river mouth, but swim inland against the current 

356
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,680
are more than likely to face the greatest obstacle: the waterfalls. 

357
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,240
After swimming along fast-flowing waters for days or weeks,

358
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,120
 the salmon now have to leap up falls which in some cases can be three metres high. 

359
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,240
Very few manage it. 

360
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,759
Exhausted by the effort, the majority are barely able to jump half the required height. 

361
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,400
But if they don’t manage it, they will die in the attempt. 

362
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,680
Little by little, new arrivals reach the bottom of the waterfall, 

363
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,919
and soon it is full of salmon trying to make the tremendous leap

364
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,200
 Their parents managed it the year before, so it is an obstacle that can be overcome. 

365
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,720
The further inland, the more exhausted the salmon will be, 

366
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,759
but Mother Nature compensates for this. 

367
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,800
Those salmon that spawn along the upper reaches arrive at the coast with more fat,

368
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,880
and so more reserves, than those that remain at the river mouths.

369
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:48,440
 Thanks to this, they will still have the strength to once again overcome the harsh trials to which Alaska faces them with. 

370
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,400
Finally, after many hardships, the salmon make it to their respective spawning grounds.

371
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,600
For some, however, it is too late. 

372
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,680
The constant effort has exhausted their strength and they have died just as success was within their grasp. 

373
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,560
Their companions are not in a much better state,

374
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,720
but hey still have a mission to fulfil, and time is running out. 

375
00:47:45,80 --> 00:47:48,680
After choosing a suitable place, the salmon prepare their nests.

376
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,240
 This consists of a small hollow which the female digs with strong movements of her tail. 

377
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,560
Behind her, a male has just chosen her as his mate,

378
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,000
 and is anxiously waiting for her to deposit the eggs, so he can fertilise them.

379
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,120
There are constant challenges from competitors, and every few seconds the male  has to fight them off.

380
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,520
 Meanwhile, the female has to contend with others trying to lay claim to her nest.

381
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,240
Each member of the couple sees off those of its same sex. 

382
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,800
Funguses already cover their emaciated bodies, like a warning of approaching death. 

383
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,840
Their time is coming to an end. 

384
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,319
When the nest is ready, the female deposits over four thousand eggs in the river bed.

385
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,320
 As she does so, the male follows behind and, with compulsive movements, covers them with semen.

386
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,480
It’s all over.

387
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,760
Thousands of miles and innumerable obstacles in order to reach this point. 

388
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,160
And once they have achieved their objective,

389
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,000
 the salmon die.

390
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,200
Yes, I’m going to die, but I’m one of the lucky ones.

391
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,359
 I fulfilled my dream and the river bed is already pulsing with the life of new salmon 

392
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,800
who will carry my blood. 

393
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,320
And they too, my children, will one day seek their destiny. 

394
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:10,80
And that day we, the salmon, will again sacrifice our lives for this land. 

395
00:50:10,80 --> 00:50:13,279
The land of our ancestors. 

396
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,320
The land in which the giant bears live.
